# 463. Island Perimeter

## Problem Statement

You are given a grid represented as a 2D array of `1`s (land) and `0`s (water). The grid represents an island, where each `1` is a piece of land and each `0` is a body of water. The island is surrounded by water, and you need to calculate the **perimeter** of the island.

### Example

Given the following grid:

```py


class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        visit = set()
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i >= len(grid) or j >= len(grid[0]) or i < 0 or j < 0 or grid[i][j] == 0:
                return 1
            if (i, j) in visit:
                return 0
            visit.add((i, j))
            perim = dfs(i, j + 1)
            perim += dfs(i + 1, j)
            perim += dfs(i, j - 1)
            perim += dfs(i - 1, j)
            return perim
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j]:
                    return dfs(i, j)
```
## 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary


In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

### Example 1

**Input:**
```python
words = ["hello", "leetcode"]
order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

**Output:**
```python
true
```

**Explanation:** As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

### Example 2

**Input:**
```python
words = ["word", "world", "row"]
order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
```

**Output:**
```python
false
```

**Explanation:** As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then `words[0] > words[1]`, hence the sequence is unsorted.

### Example 3

**Input:**
```python
words = ["apple", "app"]
order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

**Output:**
```python
false
```


```py
