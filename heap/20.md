### 1. **Kth Largest Element in a Stream**

**Difficulty**: Easy

#### Description:
Design a class that finds the kth largest element in a stream. Initially, the stream is empty, and you can add numbers.

#### Example:
```python
Input:

[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
Output: [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]
```

### Solution

```py

class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        # minHeap w/ K largest integers
        self.minHeap, self.k = nums, k
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]
